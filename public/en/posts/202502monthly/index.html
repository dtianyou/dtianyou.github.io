<hr>
<p>I randomly clicked on my Bilibili favorites and saw a bunch of videos I saved years ago.</p>
<p>The very first one I favorited was <em>Learn to Build a Gundam Model in 13 Minutes</em>â€”haha.</p>
<p>The forgotten memories of the internet came rushing back to me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many creators&rsquo; last updates were in 2024.</p>
<p>Some have deleted their accounts, yet their videos remain watchable.</p>
<p>Some transitioned from food vlogging to e-commerce, from study content to the automotive sector.</p>
<p>Wutopang, who always held onto summer, didnâ€™t make it to the summer of 2024.</p>
<p>Kiki vanished after a semi-annual update where she finished her fried beef sandwich.</p>
<p>WinterWolfâ€™s profile still lingers on a 2020 post: <em>&ldquo;Congrats to the world for gaining one more responsible adult.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>H2 Element Lab is still aroundâ€”assuming they post one element per month out of 118, they could keep going for another ten years.</p>
<p>In the digital world, every piece of your data lingers somewhereâ€”through every interaction, like, favorite, comment, and share.</p>
<p>Maybe in a Bilibili playlist, maybe in a cloud album, or maybe in the ever-expanding space of iCloud and WeChat storage.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&ldquo;The 2020 National College Entrance Examination begins today. Due to the pandemic, this yearâ€™s exam has been postponed by a month.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This marks the first time since 2003 that the exam is held in July.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>â€” Let this 1 minute and 36 seconds be my tribute to my high school years.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="thoughts-are-the-second-derivative-of-reality">Thoughts Are the Second Derivative of Reality</h2>
<p>How do we understand this?</p>
<p>You <em>want</em> to do something, so in <em>reality</em>, you do it.</p>
<p>In this case, <em>wanting</em> is the first derivative of <em>reality</em>â€”itâ€™s what causes you to take action.</p>
<p>But what influences your <em>wanting</em>?</p>
<p>What is the <em>wanting</em> of your <em>wanting</em>?</p>
<hr>
<p>Back in October last year, I thought I would become a Digital IC Verification Engineer.</p>
<p>It was a practical choiceâ€”high demand, decent pay, and somewhat relevant to my major.</p>
<p>But after my trip to Colombia, I pivoted toward MLE and LLM.</p>
<p>I realized that money and happiness arenâ€™t necessarily correlated.</p>
<p>Spending time on things that are meaningful and exciting is more important than just making money.</p>
<p>Because with limited time and energy, I want to do something I genuinely care about.</p>
<p>Latin America really is a magical place.</p>
<hr>
<p>A <em>thought</em> is the <em>wanting</em> of your <em>wanting</em>. Itâ€™s the catalyst that shifts your approach and life goals.</p>
<p>When a thought arises, have the courage to follow it!</p>
<p>Because thatâ€™s the world that truly belongs to you.</p>
<p>Be boldâ€”donâ€™t overthink it!</p>
<p>Of course, wanting something doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll automatically achieve it. It still takes work, effort, and patience.</p>
<p>And you, my friendâ€”your choices define who you will become.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="three-days-without-practice-and-the-hands-go-rusty">Three Days Without Practice, and the Hands Go Rusty</h2>
<p>My 6th-grade Chinese teacherâ€™s golden words are becoming more and more valuable.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been grinding LeetCode lately. Took a break for a day, and my hands already felt rusty.</p>
<p>I recently learned about Xiuchuan Academy. Er Ye once said that back in the day, when Liu Shahe taught there, he would walk into class with a burning incense stick, bow, and greet the students:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I bring incense as an offering. I hope you all cherish your lessons and make the most of this beautiful time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It reminded me of my first visit to Shishi Wenmiao. Seeing the two stone lions guarding the entrance and the ancient-style school gate almost made me tear up.</p>
<p>Inside, a giant stone slab bore the inscription: <em>&ldquo;One school through the ages, its brilliance shining for a thousand years.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Looking up, I saw two towering, gray-blue traditional Chinese buildingsâ€”classrooms from another era.</p>
<p>In the distance, Chengdu&rsquo;s Confucian Temple still stood on the old campus grounds.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt like I had been struckâ€”like <em>this</em> was where students truly belonged.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="moments-that-got-me-excited">Moments That Got Me Excited</h2>
<p>Running eight H100s on PACE-ICE at the same timeâ€”this tuition is finally paying off.</p>
<p>This week in my VIP course, the professor said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We need to create things no one has ever done before. Donâ€™t wait until other schools adopt it before we say we should, too. Thereâ€™s no riskâ€”if we fail and donâ€™t talk about it, no one will ever know.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Me, trying to keep up with the latest AI advancements â†’ ðŸ¤¯</p>
<p>New technologies and knowledge emerge every single day. I havenâ€™t even finished catching up on the old ones, and new ones keep coming.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="some-inefficient-meetings">Some Inefficient Meetings</h2>
<p>If you donâ€™t speak, someone else will.</p>
<p>And most of the time, theyâ€™re saying nonsense.</p>
<p>So speak upâ€”push your team forward.</p>
