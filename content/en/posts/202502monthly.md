## Good Winds, Good Fortune  

---  

I randomly clicked on my Bilibili favorites and saw a bunch of videos I saved years ago.  

The very first one I favorited was *Learn to Build a Gundam Model in 13 Minutes*â€”haha.  

The forgotten memories of the internet came rushing back to me.  

---  

Many creators' last updates were in 2024.  

Some have deleted their accounts, yet their videos remain watchable.  

Some transitioned from food vlogging to e-commerce, from study content to the automotive sector.  

Wutopang, who always held onto summer, didnâ€™t make it to the summer of 2024.  

Kiki vanished after a semi-annual update where she finished her fried beef sandwich.  

WinterWolfâ€™s profile still lingers on a 2020 post: *"Congrats to the world for gaining one more responsible adult."*  

H2 Element Lab is still aroundâ€”assuming they post one element per month out of 118, they could keep going for another ten years.  

In the digital world, every piece of your data lingers somewhereâ€”through every interaction, like, favorite, comment, and share.  

Maybe in a Bilibili playlist, maybe in a cloud album, or maybe in the ever-expanding space of iCloud and WeChat storage.

*"The 2020 National College Entrance Examination begins today. Due to the pandemic, this yearâ€™s exam has been postponed by a month."*  

*"This marks the first time since 2003 that the exam is held in July."*  

â€” Let this 1 minute and 36 seconds be my tribute to my high school years.

## Thoughts Are the Second Derivative of Reality  

How do we understand this?  

You *want* to do something, so in *reality*, you do it.  

In this case, *wanting* is the first derivative of *reality*â€”itâ€™s what causes you to take action.  

But what influences your *wanting*?  

What is the *wanting* of your *wanting*?

Back in October last year, I thought I would become a Digital IC Verification Engineer.  

It was a practical choiceâ€”high demand, decent pay, and somewhat relevant to my major.  

But after my trip to Colombia, I pivoted toward MLE and LLM.  

I realized that money and happiness arenâ€™t necessarily correlated.  

Spending time on things that are meaningful and exciting is more important than just making money.  

Because with limited time and energy, I want to do something I genuinely care about.  

Latin America really is a magical place.  

---  

A *thought* is the *wanting* of your *wanting*. Itâ€™s the catalyst that shifts your approach and life goals.  

When a thought arises, have the courage to follow it!  

Because thatâ€™s the world that truly belongs to you.  

Be boldâ€”donâ€™t overthink it!  

Of course, wanting something doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll automatically achieve it. It still takes work, effort, and patience.  

And you, my friendâ€”your choices define who you will become.

## Three Days Without Practice, and the Hands Go Rusty  

My 6th-grade Chinese teacherâ€™s golden words are becoming more and more valuable.  

Iâ€™ve been grinding LeetCode lately. Took a break for a day, and my hands already felt rusty.  

I recently learned about Xiuchuan Academy. Er Ye once said that back in the day, when Liu Shahe taught there, he would walk into class with a burning incense stick, bow, and greet the students:  

*"I bring incense as an offering. I hope you all cherish your lessons and make the most of this beautiful time."*  

It reminded me of my first visit to Shishi Wenmiao. Seeing the two stone lions guarding the entrance and the ancient-style school gate almost made me tear up.  

Inside, a giant stone slab bore the inscription: *"One school through the ages, its brilliance shining for a thousand years."*  

Looking up, I saw two towering, gray-blue traditional Chinese buildingsâ€”classrooms from another era.  

In the distance, Chengdu's Confucian Temple still stood on the old campus grounds.  

For a moment, I felt like I had been struckâ€”like *this* was where students truly belonged.

## Moments That Got Me Excited  

Running eight H100s on PACE-ICE at the same timeâ€”this tuition is finally paying off.  

This week in my VIP course, the professor said:  

*"We need to create things no one has ever done before. Donâ€™t wait until other schools adopt it before we say we should, too. Thereâ€™s no riskâ€”if we fail and donâ€™t talk about it, no one will ever know."*  

Me, trying to keep up with the latest AI advancements â†’ ðŸ¤¯  

New technologies and knowledge emerge every single day. I havenâ€™t even finished catching up on the old ones, and new ones keep coming.

## Some Inefficient Meetings  

If you donâ€™t speak, someone else will.  

And most of the time, theyâ€™re saying nonsense.  

So speak upâ€”push your team forward.
