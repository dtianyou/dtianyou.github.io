## Third Month

November marks my third month in the US. Time flies.

It feels like I haven't accomplished much - still stumbling with spoken English, and job hunting hasn't even made it to my agenda yet.

This month I experimented with many Southern Chinese dishes: steamed beef shank, three-cup chicken, roasted potatoes, spicy grilled fish, steamed sea bass, and grilled lamb chops. Hope I can maintain this enthusiasm for cooking next month too.

I've been lacking direction, living day by day, just completing whatever assignments come up in courses. Haven't really figured out my current goal - job hunting? pursuing a PhD?

## Resolutions

Making another resolution to start monthly reflections within a week of month's end. Plan to set a theme for each month, like random coffee shop exploration month, or MLE creative web product month, etc.

Theme for December - South America + MLE job hunting
